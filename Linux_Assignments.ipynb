        "\n",
        "1. What is Linux?\n",
        "    - Linux is a Open Source powerfull Operating System, does not require expensive licensing fees, making it a cost-effective choice for companies, It is stable and requires minimal maintenance, reducing operational expenses.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Also it is lightweight and consumes fewer system resources compared to Windows, it can efficiently scales from small embedded systems to enterprise data centers without performance degradation.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Linux has strong user privilege separation, making it more secure against viruses and malware, it ensures better uptime and reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is the difference between Hard Link & Soft Link?\n",
        "    - A Hard Link is an additional name for an existing file. When you create a hard link, you are creating a second directory entry that points directly to the file's data on the hard drive.\n",
        "\n",
        "      If you delete the original file, the data remains accessible through the hard link. The file is only deleted when all hard links pointing to its inode are removed.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - A Soft Link is like a shortcut or an alias. It is a small file that simply stores the path (the name and location) of the original file.\n",
        "\n",
        "      If the original file is renamed, moved, or deleted, the soft link will break because the path it's pointing to no longer exists.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is a Kernel in Linux?\n",
        "    - The Kernel is the most important piece of software in the Linux operating system. It's the core program that manages everything on your computer.\n",
        "\n",
        "      It acts as a translator between all our applications (like web browser) and physical components (like CPU, RAM, disk). Browser doesn't know how to talk to a hard drive directly, so it asks the Kernel to do the work.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. How do you create a user account?\n",
        "    - To Create user we have two commands,\n",
        "        - adduser (username): This command is interactive, it will automatically create a home folder and prompt you to set a password.\n",
        "\n",
        "        - useradd : This will creates the user account but does not create the home directory or set a password.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the ‘grep’ command used for in Linux?\n",
        "    - The 'grep' command in Linux is used to search for specific file or text, for example if we want to search the word \"Hello\" in file.txt then we can use the grep command.\n",
        "    \n",
        "      - grep \"Hello\" file.txt\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Step1: Create user p1?, Step2: He should be part of 3 groups g1,g2,g3\n",
        "    - step1: Creating the groups\n",
        "      - groupadd g1\n",
        "      - sudo groupadd g2\n",
        "      - sudo groupadd g3\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Create the user p1 and add to the groups using bellow commands\n",
        "      - sudo useradd -m -G g1,g2,g3 p1\n",
        "      - Then we need to define our primary group using bellow command\n",
        "        -   sudo usermod -g g1 p1\n",
        "7. Question no.7 answers?\n",
        "    - we need to create the dirictory first using \"sudo mkdir /tmp/bg\" command then go that directory using \"cd /tmp/bg\", then create emty file using \"sudo touch file1 file2 file3\"\n",
        "\n",
        "      then in Step 2 Make user 'abhi' the owner of the directory and its files using commands \"sudo chown -R abhi /tmp/bg\"\n",
        "\n",
        "        Then in Step 3: we have to set the permissions so that user 'abhi' can create files and delete files using commands\n",
        "        \"sudo chmod -R 700 /tmp/bg\"\n",
        "\n",
        "8. You suspect that a particular process is consuming excessive CPU resources on your Linux server. How\n",
        "would you identify and terminate this process?\n",
        "    - we can identify the process using high CPU using \"top\" command, and then kill or stop that process using PID (sudo kill PID).\n",
        "\n",
